At Colt I got my first ever job, where I was assigned the title of excel wizard. Primarily because I was good at goodling. As my first big achievement I developed a way for external customer reports to be created automatically with excel whereas before 40 service managers would create them manually taking more than a week for each service manager. This saved the company almost 50% of the time of each service manager and left them more time to take more customers on. After this achievement I got moved to the leadership team to drive more similar projects, which included KPI dashboards for the C-suite and driving the digital transformation strategy. It was also the first time I got interested in the field of AI. Machine Learning has started to become a hype.
