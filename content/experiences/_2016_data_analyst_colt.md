At Colt I got my first job, where I was titled the "excel wizard", primarily because I was good at googling. My first big achievement was an excell reporting automation, like a primitive BI, improving the way 40 service managers created reports - from spending a week to barely a few minutes. This enabled the company to increase the number of customers that coulde be service managed, increasing revenue by offering service management to more customers. After this achievement I was added to the leadership team reporting directly to the VP with a mission to drive more similar projects. This is where I started dabbling my data science journey, where I created  a customer churn prediction prototype ,  KPI dashboards for the Executive Leadership Team and the data insights behind Colt's digital transformation strategy. It was also the first time I got interested in the field of AI. Machine Learning was starting to become a buzzword.
