After teaching I was eager to get back in to game and develop some technology on my own. Voi, is one of the best and more complex data sets I have ever worked with. 
I was the first data hire of the rider domain. As a senior data analyst I took over the data ingestion (airflow & python), the data modelling (dbt) , builiding dahsboards (Tableau) and geospatial analytics (Unfolded & Python) to drive the improvement of our core rider experience.
