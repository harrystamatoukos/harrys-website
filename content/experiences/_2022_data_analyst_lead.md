In late 2021 I moved to Stockholm from London and started as a Senior Data Analyst before I became the team lead of 4. Voi, is one of the best and more complex data sets I have ever worked with, given the complexity of the micromobility industry.
I was the first data hire of the rider domain. As a senior data analyst I took over the data ingestion ```airflow & python```, the data modelling ```dbt``` , builiding dahsboards ```Tableau``` and geospatial analytics ```Unfolded & Python``` to drive the improvement of our core rider experience. 
As a team lead my team created the foundations for experimentation,  advanced analytics (```segmentation```and ```LTV modelling```) and proof of concepts on pricing and forecasting.
