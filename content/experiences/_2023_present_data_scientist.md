As a data scientist, my work has been focused in 3 main areas: 
- Algorithmic Pricing
- Forecasting
- Natural Language Processing
  
Specifically, 
- **On Algorithmic Pricing:** I developed a model ```(XGboost)``` that decided which users should get a discount to optimize revenue. This model was deployed ```(VertexAI)``` via controled experiments and resulted in 3% increase in revenue per user.
- **On Forecasting:** I developed a model ```(Hierarchichal Forecasting)``` to forecast Active Riders, quarterly and yearly. This model was developed ```(VertexAI)```, an embeded with other forecasts while achieving an accuracy of ~2-5%. 
- **On Natural Language Processing:** I used Large Language models ```(Google Gemini)``` to extract all information from users' comments in a structured way that could be used by other systems. On top of that I built an automated report that summarised the key points of users' weekly ```(GPT-4)``` which ended enabling the CPO and General Managers to drive weekly attention to problems.
