As a data scientist I have been working in the areas of algorithmic pricing, forecasting and Natural Language Processing.
Specifically, I developed a model (XGboost) that predicted which user should get a discount. This model was deployed with controled experiments (with VertexAI) and results in a 5% uplift in revenue. 
In Forecasting, I developed a model to forecast active riders, quarterly and yearly. This model was developed in python and achieved an accuracy of ~2-5%. 
In Natural Language Processing, I used Large Language models to extract all information from users' comments in a structured way that could be used by other systems. On top of that I built an automated report that summarised the key points of users' weekly which ended helping the CPO and General Managers drive weekly attention to problems.
