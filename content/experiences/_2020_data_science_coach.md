At Multiverse I was delivering lectures in Data Science and 1-to-1 coaching to 50 students. I delivered lectures in ```Statistics```, ```Python```, ```Machine Learning``` and general Data Science topics. Teaching is a very efficient way of learning fundamental topics very well, only when one has to explain something does one actually realises that one does not understand every layer of a concept. Over the course of 2 year, I delivered almost 30 lectures and 1200 1-to-1 coaching sessions.
