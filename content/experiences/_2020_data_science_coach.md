At Multiverse I was delivering lectures in Data Science and 1to1 coaching to 50 people. I delivered lectures in Statistics, Python, Machine Learning and across the board data science. Teaching is a very efficient way of learning fundamental topics very well. Only when you have to explain something do you actually realise that you don't understand every angle of the concept.
