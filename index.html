Specifically, I developed a model (XGboost) that predicted which user should get a discount. This model was deployed with controled experiments (with VertexAI) and results in a 5% uplift in revenue.
In Forecasting, I developed a model to forecast active riders, quarterly and yearly. This model was developed in python and achieved an accuracy of ~2-5%.
In Natural Language Processing, I used Large Language models to extract all information from users&rsquo; comments in a structured way that could be used by other systems. On top of that I built an automated report that summarised the key points of users&rsquo; weekly which ended helping the CPO and General Managers drive weekly attention to problems.</p></p></div></div><div class=timeline-item><div class=year>2022</div><img src=https://www.harrystamatoukos.com/images/voi_technology_logo.jpeg alt="Company Logo" class=company-logo><div class=timeline-content><h3>Senior Data Analyst and Data Lead</h3><p><p>After teaching I was eager to get back in to game and develop some technology on my own. Voi, is one of the best and more complex data sets I have ever worked with.
I was the first data hire of the rider domain. As a senior data analyst I took over the data ingestion (airflow & python), the data modelling (dbt) , builiding dahsboards (Tableau) and geospatial analytics (Unfolded & Python) to drive the improvement of our core rider experience.</p></p></div></div><div class=timeline-item><div class=year>2020</div><img src=https://www.harrystamatoukos.com/images/multiverse_logo.png alt="Company Logo" class=company-logo><div class=timeline-content><h3>Data Science Coach</h3><p><p>At Multiverse I was delivering lectures in Data Science and 1to1 coaching to 50 people. I delivered lectures in Statistics, Python, Machine Learning and across the board data science. Teaching is a very efficient way of learning fundamental topics very well. Only when you have to explain something do you actually realise that you don&rsquo;t understand every angle of the concept.</p></p></div></div><div class=timeline-item><div class=year>2016</div><img src=https://www.harrystamatoukos.com/images/colt_technology_services_logo.jpeg alt="Company Logo" class=company-logo><div class=timeline-content><h3>Strategy and Data Analyst</h3><p><p>At Colt I got my first ever job, where I was assigned the title of excel wizard. Primarily because I was good at goodling. As my first big achievement I developed a way for external customer reports to be created automatically with excel whereas before 40 service managers would create them manually taking more than a week for each service manager. This saved the company almost 50% of the time of each service manager and left them more time to take more customers on. After this achievement I got moved to the leadership team to drive more similar projects, which included KPI dashboards for the C-suite and driving the digital transformation strategy. It was also the first time I got interested in the field of AI. Machine Learning has started to become a hype.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div><footer></footer></body></html>
