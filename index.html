This model was deployed <code>(VertexAI)</code> via controled experiments and resulted in 3% increase in revenue per user.</li><li><strong>On Forecasting:</strong> I developed a model <code>(Hierarchichal Forecasting)</code> to forecast Active Riders, quarterly and yearly. This model was developed <code>(VertexAI)</code>, an embeded with other forecasts while achieving an accuracy of ~2-5%.</li><li><strong>On Natural Language Processing:</strong> I used Large Language models <code>(Google Gemini)</code> to extract all information from users&rsquo; comments in a structured way that could be used by other systems. On top of that I built an automated report that summarised the key points of users&rsquo; weekly <code>(GPT-4)</code> which ended enabling the CPO and General Managers to drive weekly attention to problems.</li></ul></p></div></div><div class=timeline-item><div class=year>2022</div><img src=https://www.harrystamatoukos.com/images/voi_technology_logo.jpeg alt="Company Logo" class=company-logo><div class=timeline-content><h3>Senior Data Analyst and Data Lead</h3><p><p>In late 2021 I moved to Stockholm from London and started as a Senior Data Analyst before I became the team lead of 4. Voi, is one of the best and more complex data sets I have ever worked with, given the complexity of the micromobility industry.
I was the first data hire of the rider domain. As a senior data analyst I took over the data ingestion <code>airflow & python</code>, the data modelling <code>dbt</code> , builiding dahsboards <code>Tableau</code> and geospatial analytics <code>Unfolded & Python</code> to drive the improvement of our core rider experience.
As a team lead my team created the foundations for experimentation, advanced analytics (<code>segmentation</code>and <code>LTV modelling</code>) and proof of concepts on pricing and forecasting.</p></p></div></div><div class=timeline-item><div class=year>2020</div><img src=https://www.harrystamatoukos.com/images/multiverse_logo.png alt="Company Logo" class=company-logo><div class=timeline-content><h3>Data Science Coach</h3><p><p>At Multiverse I was delivering lectures in Data Science and 1-to-1 coaching to 50 students. I delivered lectures in <code>Statistics</code>, <code>Python</code>, <code>Machine Learning</code> and general Data Science topics. Teaching is a very efficient way of learning fundamental topics very well, only when one has to explain something does one actually realises that one does not understand every layer of a concept. Over the course of 2 year, I delivered almost 30 lectures and 1200 1-to-1 coaching sessions.</p></p></div></div><div class=timeline-item><div class=year>2016</div><img src=https://www.harrystamatoukos.com/images/colt_technology_services_logo.jpeg alt="Company Logo" class=company-logo><div class=timeline-content><h3>Strategy and Data Analyst</h3><p><p>At Colt I got my first job, where I was titled the &ldquo;excel wizard&rdquo;, primarily because I was good at googling. My first big achievement was an excell reporting automation, like a primitive BI, improving the way 40 service managers created reports - from spending a week to barely a few minutes. This enabled the company to increase the number of customers that coulde be service managed, increasing revenue by offering service management to more customers. After this achievement I was added to the leadership team reporting directly to the VP with a mission to drive more similar projects. This is where I started dabbling my data science journey, where I created a customer churn prediction prototype , KPI dashboards for the Executive Leadership Team and the data insights behind Colt&rsquo;s digital transformation strategy. It was also the first time I got interested in the field of AI. Machine Learning was starting to become a buzzword.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div><footer></footer></body></html>
